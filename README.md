# FilmQueryProject
## Description
This film query application combines Java OOP (object oriented programming) and mySQL ORM (object relational mapping). The application imitates a video store, such as Blockbuster, however this application has a nostalgic twist by making references to a classic 90's nickelodeon TV show called _The Amanda Show_. ![picture alt](https://preview.redd.it/25aqtdqh89o91.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=16291bfa4eddadca5e7e7712d41e3063b6ae57f8 "The Amanda Show")

The user is greeted then asked to select a menu option, the applciation takes the users' input then creates the output correlated to the menu option selected. The intention with this program is to utilize the conenction with a database, which queries films based on given index or keywords, and supplies the user with information about the film.

 ## Lessons Learned
 Overall, wasn't too difficult, I had a couple hiccups here and there, this was our first assignement implementing mySQL/SQL with Java so I knew there was a likelihood of getting stuck in some places. Main thing learned was just repition with SQL commands/syntax.
